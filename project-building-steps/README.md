# How to build React.js project

## üèÅ Intro

**If it's your first time reading this, read this to understand the thought process and the reason for writing this guide.**

Building a React app is more than using Create React App scripts to make your project and hack away coding.

You will need to think about many other things:

- What is my goal in doing this project
- How many people are going to work on this project
- How will I use versioning software
- What project structure should I use
- How will I write my CSS
- Do I need to set some naming conventions on files and coding
- Should I use Prettier or Eslint or both to manage my code formatting
- Should I use third-party component library

Depending on how you answer the question above the way and stuff you need to do will differ.

For example: If are the only one working on this project you will not care about any collaboration tools or formatting and naming guidelines. Even though this is fine on its own you should think about whether will this make you a better programmer. In the majority of cases, it will not.

The things mentioned above are not the only things that you should think about. These are only some of the things that experienced programmers think about on daily bases when starting a new project.

1. **The main purpose of this document is to define important steps that you should think about when building react projects.**

2. **Identify the steps you are not familiar with and learn why are they important.**

3. **Identify ways for yourself to become a better programmer.**

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Pick your poison

Depending on how difficult you want the project to be there are the following difficulty levels.

1. ü•∏ **I want to get it over with!** <br>
   For this, you will only choose stuff that you are familiar with and not even look at the stuff you have no idea about.

2. üòé **I like when life throws rocks at me!** <br>
   Here you will always try to choose stuff that you are not familiar with. But you will also learn why that thing is better or worse than other stuff.

3. ü§ì **I like feeling the pain of Typescript!** <br>
   For this one take all from the previous one but do it all in Typescript.

## üöÄ Creating the project

For most beginners, there is the holy grail called Create React App, or CRA for short.

The CRA is a good library and is recommended by React official documentation for a good reason.

But it's not the only way and not the best way to make React projects either.

The best way depends on your project and I recommend taking following tools into consideration:

### [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/)

- Familiar to most people
- It is quick and painless to start

### [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

- New and incredibly fast
- You will never care about static pages

### [Remix](https://remix.run/)

- You really love react-router
- Learn something new

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

- Want to have front-end and back-end in same app
- Your project needs to have static pages

## üìÑ Project structure

There is no real main way of structuring your project and most people do it how they want.

But we definitely want some structure to our projects.

So I recommend reading this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/) that describes the evolution of React project folder structure and choosing one step.

## üõ† Formatting and linting tools

Linters and code formatters are tools that keep your code clean and consistent with established coding conventions.

A linter analyzes your code and alerts you to common programming and syntax errors.

Code formatter will restructure the appearance of your code to match style guidelines, but it won‚Äôt analyze your code for errors.

Linting and formatting tools are used in most teams, so getting to know how to use them can get you extra points in interviews.

### Formatters

The formatter are is mandatory to use in any project.

I recommend [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

You can either add it as a plugin in VSCode or set up a config file inside your project.

[Config file setup](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)

### Linters

You will not lose much if you don't add a linter to your project.

But once you install them once and see the beauty of autocomplete options you get with them it is hard to go back.

The linter I recommend is [eslint](https://eslint.org/).

It is not easy setting it up for the first time and it can be confusing. But it will definitely bring you a lot of value to your project.

You can look at this [article](https://medium.com/@RossWhitehouse/setting-up-eslint-in-react-c20015ef35f7) for guide how to setup eslint for react project.

The plugins I recommend for React projects:

- [React plugin](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react)
- [React Hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
- [Eslint plugin Import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import)

[Eslint plugin prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) is mandatory if if you are using prettier.

## üñå CSS

There are a lot of ways to write CSS in React projects.

There is no clear best way but you should be familiar with at least 2 or 3 ways of doing it. Since you never know what you will have to use on your next project.

### CSS

Supported out of the box.

Plain old CSS you can't go wrong here.

It does have problems with adding themes and CSS collisions.

But if you have a good naming scheme it should do the job.

### SCSS

It's very similar to CSS but requires extra learning steps.

It has the same problem with CSS collisions.

A better way of writings CSS.

### CSS Modules

If you want to use the CSS files to write your code I would go for modules instead of plain CSS.

They solve the problem with CSS collisions.

You can have problems with importing classes.

### CSS-in-JS

CSS in JS is used as a way of writing CSS inside JavaScript code.

It requires a third-party library to work.

It is the cleanest way of writing CSS in React.

Popular are [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

### CSS class libraries

I don't recommend this choice for personal reasons.

Can be a pain when you have a lot of classes on components.

Popular are [bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).

## üëÄ Third party libraries

If you ever go to the NPM website and look at how many JS libraries exist you will be amazed. But most of those libraries are not useful or good to add to your project.

Every library you add to your project represents an extra dependency.
When you have a small number of dependencies it's easy to maintain your project.
When you have a lot it's a nightmare and no one wants to upgrade the libraries on the project.

So there are some rules I follow when I add libraries to my projects:

- Only add libraries that you can't easily recreate and have good community support.
- Don't add libraries to your project before you need them.
- If you need one function from a library don't add the whole library. Copy that function from the source code and add it to your project.

**There is a library called [isOdd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) and it has 400k weekly downloads.**

This just shows how many libraries people add to their projects. Just by writing `value % 2 === 1` you can do this by yourself there is no reason to add this library. But it seems a lot people don't know how to do this.

### Component Libraries

Component libraries are a good way to reduce the development time of your project. They come with out-of-the-box components you need for your project.

The pros:

- You don't have to style your inputs, buttons, modals, etc... from scratch
- Most of the components you need are there for a small project
- Most have options to customize your theme

The cons:

- You are stuck with it forever
- When it works it's amazing and when it doesn't you are stuck to solving it yourself.
- If you find a bug it can take some time for it to be fixed.

Some of the popular component libraries:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Ant design](https://ant.design/)
- [Fluent](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/get-started)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### Routing Libraries

If you want your app to look like it's a multiple page application you will need to use a router.

Some of the popular routers:

- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/getting-started/overview)
- [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter)

### Global state management libraries

I would argue that React context API is enough for most React applications. But the reality is that we all have different opinions.

So why I would consider adding other global state managers:

- I have too many contexts and the app is slowly going to [context hell](https://marcopeg.com/context-provider-hell/)
- My application is slow and has too many rerenders
- The state is too complex for the context API
- I want to try something new for myself

Popular global state managers:

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Mobex](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)

### Fetching libraries

You can't have an app without fetching some data from the internet.

Some of popular libraries:

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/overview)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

## üë®‚Äçüíª Coding

Coding... This is a very big topic and I can't really cover it here.

But here are some general advice:

- So to get better at coding simplest advice is to code more.
- To be a better developer/engineer get used to code with other people on the same project.
- To be faster at coding get used to reading other people's code.
