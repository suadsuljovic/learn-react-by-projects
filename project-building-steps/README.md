# How to build React.js projects step by step

# Intro

**If it's your first time reading this. Read this to understand the thought process and the reason for writing this guide.**

Building a React app is more than using Create React App scripts to make your project and hack away coding.

You will need to think about many other things:

- What is my goal in doing this project
- How many people are going to work on this project
- How will I use versioning software
- What project structure should I use
- How will I write my CSS
- Do I need to set some naming conventions on files and coding
- Should I use Prettier or Eslint or both to manage my code formatting
- Should I use third-party component library

Depending on how you answer the question above the way and stuff you need to do will differ.

For example: If are the only one working on this project you will not care about any collaboration tools or formatting and naming guidelines. Even though this is fine on its own you should think about whether will this make you a better programmer. In the majority of cases, it will not.

The things mentioned above are not the only things that you should think about. These are only some of the things that experienced programmers think about on daily bases when starting a new project.

So the main purpose of this document is to define important steps that you should think about when building react projects.

The second purpose is to identify the steps you are not familiar with and learn why are they important.

The third one is to also identify ways for yourself to become a better programmer.
