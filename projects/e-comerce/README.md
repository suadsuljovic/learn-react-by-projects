## Introduction

As a skilled developer, I aim to showcase my expertise by creating this e-commerce platform. With a focus on user experience, I want to build a system that allows easy management of products and engages users effectively.

## Backend

Opting for the Strapi open-source headless CMS, I'll set up a local Strapi project. Configure necessary collections such as Products, Authors, Categories, etc., to ensure seamless functionality.

## Frontend

Craft a unique and visually appealing design for the e-commerce platform using React. The specific features and components are open to interpretation, with each part increasing in complexity and development time.

## Bonus

Implement the entire project using TypeScript to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
